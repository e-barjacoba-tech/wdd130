        <p>
            My name is Ezequiel Matias Barjacoba. I am from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. I am the eldest of four siblings.
            Everyone in
            my family
            is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. We moved to this city to have a Temple near
            us!
            I served my mission in Brazil, Feira de Santana (Bahia State). I served there from April 2023 to May 2025. I
            know how to speak there
            languages: spanish, english, and portuguese. I love reading, I love teaching, and I love creating pretty
            much anything that represents me
            as a person! From lyrics to songs and melodies, to a basic website like this one. I'm excited to keep
            learning
            and to keep growing my
            abilities within the programming field.
